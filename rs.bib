@article{CarpenterEa2017,
	Abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

It also has been applied in a variety of areas other than animal learning. We summarize the contribution of the Rescorla-Wagner model to research in verbal learning, social psychology, human category learning, human judgments of correlational relationships, transitive inference, color aftereffects, and physiological regulation. We conclude that there have been few models in experimental psychology as influential as the Rescorla-Wagner model.},

@phdthesis{Schaefer2010,
	Abstract = {In this dissertation, a syntax-semantics interface for Neo-Davidsonian Event Semantics is developed, which provides a compositional mechanism free of variables and lambda abstraction and based purely on function composition. Furthermore, besides recursively defined functional types, only a single basic type (the type of objects) is assumed. The presented syntax-semantics interface has the advantage of allowing arguments and adjuncts to apply at any stage without any type adaptations or cumbersome lambda constructs. This is achieved by detaching Neo-Davidsonian role encodings from the semantic representation of the verb, resulting in the verb denoting just a set of events. Semantically, both subcategorized arguments of a verb and adjuncts are then treated as exactly the same kind of operator on verb meanings. They have the same type, and they have parallel model-theoretic interpretations: They produce appropriate sets of events from input sets of events. The main part of the dissertation is devoted to showing that such operators are definable for quantified noun phrases. Additionally, negation, alternative meaning, and effects of cumulativity and distributivity are also discussed. An additional chapter is devoted to showing that the basic compositional mechanism can be implemented in a formalized theory of syntax, viz. Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). The implementation in HPSG shows that the developed semantics framework, although complex in its definition, can lead to highly elegant derivations.},

@article{Schaefer2016c,
	Abstract = {Over the past decade, multifactorial corpus-based explorations of alternations in grammar have been prominently used to support theories and frameworks within cognitively oriented corpus linguistics. For example, prototype theory as a theory of similarity-based and inherently probabilistic linguistic categorization has received support from studies showing that alternating constructions and items often occur with probabilities influenced by prototypical semantic or contextual factors. In this paper, I analyze a low-frequency alternation effect in German noun inflection in terms of prototype theory, based on strong hypotheses from the existing literature that I integrate into an established theoretical framework of usage-based probabilistic morphology, which allows us to account for similarity effects even in seemingly regular areas of the grammar. Specifically, the so-called weak masculine nouns in German, which follow an unusual pattern of case marking and often have characteristic lexical properties, sporadically occur in forms of the dominant strong masculine nouns. Using data from the nine-billion-token DECOW12A web corpus of contemporary German, I demonstrate that the probability of the alternation is influenced by the presence or absence of semantic, phonotactic, and paradigmatic features. Token frequency is also shown to have an effect on the alternation, in line with common assumptions about the relation between frequency and entrenchment. I use a version of prototype theory with weighted features and polycentric categories, but I also discuss the question of whether corpus data can be taken as strong evidence for or against specific models of cognitive representation (prototypes vs. exemplars).},

	Abstract = {We discuss cliticized indefinite articles in written German, both ``regular'' reduced forms (ein `a' → n) and extended forms (ein → nen). Previous analyses of factors that favor written realizations of both variants are based on too sparse data for inferential statistics. We fill this gap, demonstrating that quantitative graphemics for non-standard writing is possible.
We us a large web corpus for our studies. By analyzing incoherent usage of cliticized and non-cliticized forms in conjuncts, we demonstrate that the two forms partially alternate randomly. We then show that the general loss of the genitive in informal writing does not explain why cliticized genitives do not occur at all. In two further studies, we apply logistic regression, finding that cliticization is disfavored in certain contexts (sentence-initially, after prepositions) and favored in others (when the non-cliticized form is bisyllabic), but that purely phonological factors (preceding vowel) are not significant. Finally, we show that full written cliticization (nurn `only a') only occurs when the shape of the cliticized article by itself is insufficient as a well-formed graphemic word (like n).
Lastly, we argue that the phenomenon is at least partly a genuinely graphemic one, going beyond mere phonographical renderings of spoken language, and we discuss the results from a paradigm perspective.},
