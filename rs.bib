	Abstract = {Over the last decade, methods of web corpus construction and the evaluation of web corpora have been actively researched. Prominently, the WaCky initiative has provided both theoretical results and a set of web corpora for selected European languages. We present a software toolkit for web corpus construction and a set of siginificantly larger corpora (up to over 9 billion tokens) built using this software. First, we discuss how the data should be collected to ensure that it is not biased towards certain hosts. Then, we describe our software toolkit which performs basic cleanups as well as boilerplate removal, simple connected text detection as well as shingling to remove duplicates from the corpora. We finally report evaluation results of the corpora built so far, for example w. r. t. the amount of duplication contained and the text type/genre distribution. Where applicable, we compare our corpora to the WaCky corpora, since it is inappropriate, in our view, to compare web corpora to traditional or balanced corpora. While we use some methods applied by the WaCky initiative, we can show that we have introduced incremental improvements.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we give an overview about the necessary steps to construct high-quality corpora from web texts. We first focus on web crawling and the pros and cons of the existing crawling strategies. Then, we describe how the crawled data can be linguistically pre-processed in a parallelized way that allows the processing of web-scale input data. As we are working with web data, controlling the quality of the resulting corpus is an important issue, which we address by showing how corpus statistics and a linguistic evaluation can be used to assess the quality of corpora. Finally, we show how the availability of extremely large, high-quality corpora opens up new directions for research in various fields of linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing.},

@article{CarpenterEa2017,
	Abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

@article{Cumming2014,
	Abstract = {We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct research. First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

@mastersthesis{Helmers2013,
	Abstract = {Eigennamenerkennung ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil der maschinellen Aufbereitung von Texten. Sowohl f{\"u}r die theoretische Linguistik als auch f{\"u}r weiterf{\"u}hrende automatische Sprachverarbeitungsschritte stellt sie eine wesentliche Voraussetzung dar. Besonders f{\"u}r die morphologisch komplexe Sprache Deutsch ist dies eine Herausforderung, nicht zuletzt, da es sich um eine der wenigen Sprachen handelt, in der zus{\"a}tzlich zu Eigennamen (EN) auch alle anderen Substantive gro{\ss} geschrieben werden. Somit f{\"a}llt die Kapitalisierung von W{\"o}rtern als grundlegender Hinweis f{\"u}r das Vorliegen eines EN weg. Dies f{\"u}hrt zu einer wesentlich schlechteren Performanz von EN-Erkennern auf deutschen Texten im Vergleich zu englischen beispielsweise. Dieser Performanzunterschied l{\"a}sst sich bereits f{\"u}r meist stark editiertes Zeitungsmaterial beobachten. Unter dem Aspekt der wachsenden Bedeutung von Internetdaten als Grundlage f{\"u}r linguistische Forschung ist es nun besonders relevant zu {\"u}berpr{\"u}fen, wie verl{\"a}sslich EN-Erkenner auf den meist sehr heterogenen Web-Korpora funktionieren, in denen auch eher spontansprachliches Material, wie beispielsweise Forentexte, enthalten ist. In Rahmen dieser Arbeit habe ich daher drei frei zug{\"a}ngliche state-of-the-art Software-Tools auf einem aus dem webgecrawlten DECOW2012-Korpus abgeleiteten, manuell erstellten Goldstandard evaluiert, die speziell f{\"u}r die EN-Erkennung in deutschen Texten entworfen wurden. Der f{\"u}r den Goldstandard genutzte Teil des DECOW2012 wurde zuvor nach Genres klassifiziert, sodass genaue Aussagen {\"u}ber den Performanzunterschied der Tools auf st{\"a}rker editierten und weniger editierten Textsorten m{\"o}glich ist. Zus{\"a}tzlich wird eine detaillierte statistische Fehleranalyse durchgef{\"u}hrt, woraus abschlie{\ss}end M{\"o}glichkeiten zur Verbesserung der Performanz von automatischen EN-Erkennungsprogrammen abgeleitet werden.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a corpus-based thesaurus and WordNet were used to improve text categorization performance. We employed the k-NN algorithm and the back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms as the classifiers. The k-NN is a simple and famous approach for categorization, and the \{BPNNs\} has been widely used in the categorization and pattern recognition fields. However the standard \{BPNN\} has some generally acknowledged limitations, such as a slow training speed and can be easily trapped into a local minimum. To alleviate the problems of the standard BPNN, two modified versions, Morbidity neurons Rectified \{BPNN\} (MRBP) and Learning Phase Evaluation \{BPNN\} (LPEBP), were considered and applied to the text categorization. We conducted the experiments on both the standard reuter-21578 data set and the 20 Newsgroups data set. Experimental results showed that our proposed methods achieved high categorization effectiveness as measured by the precision, recall and F-measure protocols.},

@article{Luo201112708,
	Abstract = {Traditional term weighting schemes in text categorization, such as TF-IDF, only exploit the statistical information of terms in documents. Instead, in this paper, we propose a novel term weighting scheme by exploiting the semantics of categories and indexing terms. Specifically, the semantics of categories are represented by senses of terms appearing in the category labels as well as the interpretation of them by WordNet. Also, the weight of a term is correlated to its semantic similarity with a category. Experimental results on three commonly used data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms TF-IDF in the cases that the amount of training data is small or the content of documents is focused on well-defined categories. In addition, the proposed approach compares favorably with two previous studies.},

@article{Onan2016232,
	Abstract = {Abstract Automatic keyword extraction is an important research direction in text mining, natural language processing and information retrieval. Keyword extraction enables us to represent text documents in a condensed way. The compact representation of documents can be helpful in several applications, such as automatic indexing, automatic summarization, automatic classification, clustering and filtering. For instance, text classification is a domain with high dimensional feature space challenge. Hence, extracting the most important/relevant words about the content of the document and using these keywords as the features can be extremely useful. In this regard, this study examines the predictive performance of five statistical keyword extraction methods (most frequent measure based keyword extraction, term frequency-inverse sentence frequency based keyword extraction, co-occurrence statistical information based keyword extraction, eccentricity-based keyword extraction and TextRank algorithm) on classification algorithms and ensemble methods for scientific text document classification (categorization). In the study, a comprehensive study of comparing base learning algorithms (Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression and Random Forest) with five widely utilized ensemble methods (AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, Random Subspace and Majority Voting) is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis, which evaluates the effectiveness of statistical keyword extraction methods in conjunction with ensemble learning algorithms. The classification schemes are compared in terms of classification accuracy, F-measure and area under curve values. To validate the empirical analysis, two-way \{ANOVA\} test is employed. The experimental analysis indicates that Bagging ensemble of Random Forest with the most-frequent based keyword extraction method yields promising results for text classification. For \{ACM\} document collection, the highest average predictive performance (93.80%) is obtained with the utilization of the most frequent based keyword extraction method with Bagging ensemble of Random Forest algorithm. In general, Bagging and Random Subspace ensembles of Random Forest yield promising results. The empirical analysis indicates that the utilization of keyword-based representation of text documents in conjunction with ensemble learning can enhance the predictive performance and scalability of text classification schemes, which is of practical importance in the application fields of text classification.},

@article{Perezgonzalez2014,
	Abstract = {Significance testing has been controversial since Neyman and Pearson published their procedure for testing statistical hypotheses. Fisher, who popularized tests of significance, first noticed the emerging confusion between that procedure and his own, yet he could not stop their hybridization into what is nowadays known as Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). Here I hypothesize why similar attempts to clarify matters have also failed; namely because both procedures are designed to be confused: their names may not match purpose, both use null hypotheses and levels of significance yet for different goals, and p-values, errors, alternative hypotheses, and significance only apply to one procedure yet are commonly used with both. I also propose a reconceptualization of the procedures to prevent further confusion.},

This distinguishes my approach from previous approaches which are merely partial and use non-standard ontologies and semantics for the marked constructions.},

	Abstract = {In this dissertation, a syntax-semantics interface for Neo-Davidsonian Event Semantics is developed, which provides a compositional mechanism free of variables and lambda abstraction and based purely on function composition. Furthermore, besides recursively defined functional types, only a single basic type (the type of objects) is assumed. The presented syntax-semantics interface has the advantage of allowing arguments and adjuncts to apply at any stage without any type adaptations or cumbersome lambda constructs. This is achieved by detaching Neo-Davidsonian role encodings from the semantic representation of the verb, resulting in the verb denoting just a set of events. Semantically, both subcategorized arguments of a verb and adjuncts are then treated as exactly the same kind of operator on verb meanings. They have the same type, and they have parallel model-theoretic interpretations: They produce appropriate sets of events from input sets of events. The main part of the dissertation is devoted to showing that such operators are definable for quantified noun phrases. Additionally, negation, alternative meaning, and effects of cumulativity and distributivity are also discussed. An additional chapter is devoted to showing that the basic compositional mechanism can be implemented in a formalized theory of syntax, viz. Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). The implementation in HPSG shows that the developed semantics framework, although complex in its definition, can lead to highly elegant derivations.},

Therefore, stand-off annotations or other derivates are the only format in which European researchers (like myself) are allowed to re-distribute the respective corpora. In order to make the full corpora available to the public despite such restrictions, the stand-off format presented here allows anybody to locally reconstruct the full corpora with the least possible computational effort.},

@article{Schaefer2016b,
	Abstract = {Removal of boilerplate is one of the essential tasks in web corpus construction and web indexing. Boilerplate (redundant and automatically inserted material like menus, copyright notices, navigational elements, etc.) is usually considered to be linguistically unattractive for inclusion in a web corpus. Also, search engines should not index such material because it can lead to spurious results for search terms if these terms appear in boilerplate regions of the web page. The size of large web corpora necessitates the use of efficient algorithms while a high accuracy directly improves the quality of the final corpus. In this paper, I present and evaluate a supervised machine learning approach to general-purpose boilerplate detection for languages based on Latin alphabets which is both very efficient and very accurate. Using a Multilayer Perceptron and a high number of carefully engineered features, I achieve between 95% and 99% correct classifications (depending on the input language) with precision and recall over 0.95. Since the perceptrons are trained on language-specific data, I also evaluate how well perceptrons trained on one language perform on other languages. The single features are also evaluated for the merit they contribute to the classification. I show that the accuracy of the Multilayer Perceptron is on a par with that of other classifiers such as Support Vector Machines.
I conclude that the quality of general-purpose boilerplate detectors depends mainly on the availability of many well-engineered features and which are highly language-independent.
The method has been implemented in the open-source texrex web page cleaning software, and large corpora constructed using it are available from the COW initiative, including the CommonCOW corpora created from CommonCrawl data sets.},

@article{Schaefer2016c,
	Abstract = {Over the past decade, multifactorial corpus-based explorations of alternations in grammar have been prominently used to support theories and frameworks within cognitively oriented corpus linguistics. For example, prototype theory as a theory of similarity-based and inherently probabilistic linguistic categorization has received support from studies showing that alternating constructions and items often occur with probabilities influenced by prototypical semantic or contextual factors. In this paper, I analyze a low-frequency alternation effect in German noun inflection in terms of prototype theory, based on strong hypotheses from the existing literature that I integrate into an established theoretical framework of usage-based probabilistic morphology, which allows us to account for similarity effects even in seemingly regular areas of the grammar. Specifically, the so-called weak masculine nouns in German, which follow an unusual pattern of case marking and often have characteristic lexical properties, sporadically occur in forms of the dominant strong masculine nouns. Using data from the nine-billion-token DECOW12A web corpus of contemporary German, I demonstrate that the probability of the alternation is influenced by the presence or absence of semantic, phonotactic, and paradigmatic features. Token frequency is also shown to have an effect on the alternation, in line with common assumptions about the relation between frequency and entrenchment. I use a version of prototype theory with weighted features and polycentric categories, but I also discuss the question of whether corpus data can be taken as strong evidence for or against specific models of cognitive representation (prototypes vs. exemplars).},

	Abstract = {Over the last decade, methods of web corpus construction and the evaluation of web corpora have been actively researched. Prominently, the WaCky initiative has provided both theoretical results and a set of web corpora for selected European languages. We present a software toolkit for web corpus construction and a set of siginificantly larger corpora (up to over 9 billion tokens) built using this software. First, we discuss how the data should be collected to ensure that it is not biased towards certain hosts. Then, we describe our software toolkit which performs basic cleanups as well as boilerplate removal, simple connected text detection as well as shingling to remove duplicates from the corpora. We finally report evaluation results of the corpora built so far, for example w. r. t. the amount of duplication contained and the text type/genre distribution. Where applicable, we compare our corpora to the WaCky corpora, since it is inappropriate, in our view, to compare web corpora to traditional or balanced corpora. While we use some methods applied by the WaCky initiative, we can show that we have introduced incremental improvements.},

	Abstract = {The World Wide Web constitutes the largest existing source of texts written in a great variety of languages. A feasible and sound way of exploiting this data for linguistic research is to compile a static corpus for a given language. There are several adavantages of this approach: (i) Working with such corpora obviates the problems encountered when using Internet search engines in quantitative linguistic research (such as non-transparent ranking algorithms). (ii) Creating a corpus from web data is virtually free. (iii) The size of corpora compiled from the WWW may exceed by several orders of magnitudes the size of language resources offered elsewhere. (iv) The data is locally available to the user, and it can be linguistically post-processed and queried with the tools preferred by her/him. This book addresses the main practical tasks in the creation of web corpora up to giga-token size. Among these tasks are the sampling process (i.e., web crawling) and the usual cleanups including boilerplate removal and removal of duplicated content. Linguistic processing and problems with linguistic processing coming from the different kinds of noise in web corpora are also covered. Finally, the authors show how web corpora can be evaluated and compared to other corpora (such as traditionally compiled corpora).},

Web documents often contain material which disqualifies them from inclusion in a corpus (tag clouds, lists of names or nouns, etc.). First, we look at the agreement between coders (especially corpus designers) given the task of rating text quality. Then, we evaluate a simple and fully unsupervised method of text quality assessment based on short and very frequent words. Finally, we describe our general approach to the construction of carefully cleansed and non-destructively normalized web corpora. Under this approach, we annotate documents with quality metrics instead of actually removing those documents classified as being of low quality.},

	Abstract = {In web corpus construction, crawling is a necessary step, and it is probably the most costly of all, because it requires expensive bandwidth usage, and excess crawling increases storage requirements. Excess crawling results from the fact that the web contains a lot of redundant content (duplicates and near-duplicates), as well as other material not suitable or desirable for inclusion in web corpora or web indexes (for example, pages with little text or virtually no text at all). An optimized crawler for web corpus construction would ideally avoid crawling such content in the first place, saving bandwidth, storage, and post-processing costs. In this paper, we show in three experiments that two simple scores are suitable to improve the ratio between corpus size and crawling effort for web corpus construction. The first score is related to overall text quality of the page containing the link, the other one is related to the likelihood that the local block enclosing a link is boilerplate.},

	Abstract = {We discuss cliticized indefinite articles in written German, both ``regular'' reduced forms (ein `a' → n) and extended forms (ein → nen). Previous analyses of factors that favor written realizations of both variants are based on too sparse data for inferential statistics. We fill this gap, demonstrating that quantitative graphemics for non-standard writing is possible.
We us a large web corpus for our studies. By analyzing incoherent usage of cliticized and non-cliticized forms in conjuncts, we demonstrate that the two forms partially alternate randomly. We then show that the general loss of the genitive in informal writing does not explain why cliticized genitives do not occur at all. In two further studies, we apply logistic regression, finding that cliticization is disfavored in certain contexts (sentence-initially, after prepositions) and favored in others (when the non-cliticized form is bisyllabic), but that purely phonological factors (preceding vowel) are not significant. Finally, we show that full written cliticization (nurn `only a') only occurs when the shape of the cliticized article by itself is insufficient as a well-formed graphemic word (like n).
Lastly, we argue that the phenomenon is at least partly a genuinely graphemic one, going beyond mere phonographical renderings of spoken language, and we discuss the results from a paradigm perspective.},

	Abstract = {The theory of Pavlovian conditioning presented by Robert Rescorla and Allan Wagner in 1972 (the Rescorla-Wagner model) has been enormously important in animal learning research. It also has been applied in a variety of areas other than animal learning. We summarize the contribution of the Rescorla-Wagner model to research in verbal learning, social psychology, human category learning, human judgments of correlational relationships, transitive inference, color aftereffects, and physiological regulation. We conclude that there have been few models in experimental psychology as influential as the Rescorla-Wagner model.},

@article{Zhang20112758,
	Abstract = {One of the main themes in text mining is text representation, which is fundamental and indispensable for text-based intellegent information processing. Generally, text representation inludes two tasks: indexing and weighting. This paper has comparatively studied TF*IDF, \{LSI\} and multi-word for text representation. We used a Chinese and an English document collection to respectively evaluate the three methods in information retreival and text categorization. Experimental results have demonstrated that in text categorization, \{LSI\} has better performance than other methods in both document collections. Also, \{LSI\} has produced the best performance in retrieving English documents. This outcome has shown that \{LSI\} has both favorable semantic and statistical quality and is different with the claim that \{LSI\} can not produce discriminative power for indexing.},
