	Abstract = {In this paper, a corpus-based thesaurus and WordNet were used to improve text categorization performance. We employed the k-NN algorithm and the back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms as the classifiers. The k-NN is a simple and famous approach for categorization, and the \{BPNNs\} has been widely used in the categorization and pattern recognition fields. However the standard \{BPNN\} has some generally acknowledged limitations, such as a slow training speed and can be easily trapped into a local minimum. To alleviate the problems of the standard BPNN, two modified versions, Morbidity neurons Rectified \{BPNN\} (MRBP) and Learning Phase Evaluation \{BPNN\} (LPEBP), were considered and applied to the text categorization. We conducted the experiments on both the standard reuter-21578 data set and the 20 Newsgroups data set. Experimental results showed that our proposed methods achieved high categorization effectiveness as measured by the precision, recall and F-measure protocols. },

	Abstract = {One of the main themes in text mining is text representation, which is fundamental and indispensable for text-based intellegent information processing. Generally, text representation inludes two tasks: indexing and weighting. This paper has comparatively studied TF*IDF, \{LSI\} and multi-word for text representation. We used a Chinese and an English document collection to respectively evaluate the three methods in information retreival and text categorization. Experimental results have demonstrated that in text categorization, \{LSI\} has better performance than other methods in both document collections. Also, \{LSI\} has produced the best performance in retrieving English documents. This outcome has shown that \{LSI\} has both favorable semantic and statistical quality and is different with the claim that \{LSI\} can not produce discriminative power for indexing. },

@article{Luo201112708,
	Abstract = {Traditional term weighting schemes in text categorization, such as TF-IDF, only exploit the statistical information of terms in documents. Instead, in this paper, we propose a novel term weighting scheme by exploiting the semantics of categories and indexing terms. Specifically, the semantics of categories are represented by senses of terms appearing in the category labels as well as the interpretation of them by WordNet. Also, the weight of a term is correlated to its semantic similarity with a category. Experimental results on three commonly used data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms TF-IDF in the cases that the amount of training data is small or the content of documents is focused on well-defined categories. In addition, the proposed approach compares favorably with two previous studies. },

@article{Onan2016232,
	Abstract = {Abstract Automatic keyword extraction is an important research direction in text mining, natural language processing and information retrieval. Keyword extraction enables us to represent text documents in a condensed way. The compact representation of documents can be helpful in several applications, such as automatic indexing, automatic summarization, automatic classification, clustering and filtering. For instance, text classification is a domain with high dimensional feature space challenge. Hence, extracting the most important/relevant words about the content of the document and using these keywords as the features can be extremely useful. In this regard, this study examines the predictive performance of five statistical keyword extraction methods (most frequent measure based keyword extraction, term frequency-inverse sentence frequency based keyword extraction, co-occurrence statistical information based keyword extraction, eccentricity-based keyword extraction and TextRank algorithm) on classification algorithms and ensemble methods for scientific text document classification (categorization). In the study, a comprehensive study of comparing base learning algorithms (Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression and Random Forest) with five widely utilized ensemble methods (AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, Random Subspace and Majority Voting) is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis, which evaluates the effectiveness of statistical keyword extraction methods in conjunction with ensemble learning algorithms. The classification schemes are compared in terms of classification accuracy, F-measure and area under curve values. To validate the empirical analysis, two-way \{ANOVA\} test is employed. The experimental analysis indicates that Bagging ensemble of Random Forest with the most-frequent based keyword extraction method yields promising results for text classification. For \{ACM\} document collection, the highest average predictive performance (93.80%) is obtained with the utilization of the most frequent based keyword extraction method with Bagging ensemble of Random Forest algorithm. In general, Bagging and Random Subspace ensembles of Random Forest yield promising results. The empirical analysis indicates that the utilization of keyword-based representation of text documents in conjunction with ensemble learning can enhance the predictive performance and scalability of text classification schemes, which is of practical importance in the application fields of text classification. },

Therefore, stand-off annotations or other derivates are the only format in which European researchers (like myself) are allowed to re-distribute the respective corpora.

@article{Schaefer2016b,
	Abstract = {Removal of boilerplate is one of the essential tasks in web corpus construction and web indexing. Boilerplate (redundant and automatically inserted material like menus, copyright notices, navigational elements, etc.) is usually considered to be linguistically unattractive for inclusion in a web corpus. Also, search engines should not index such material because it can lead to spurious results for search terms if these terms appear in boilerplate regions of the web page. The size of large web corpora necessitates the use of efficient algorithms while a high accuracy directly improves the quality of the final corpus. In this paper, I present and evaluate a supervised machine learning approach to general-purpose boilerplate detection for languages based on Latin alphabets which is both very efficient and very accurate. Using a Multilayer Perceptron and a high number of carefully engineered features, I achieve between 95% and 99% correct classifications (depending on the input language) with precision and recall over 0.95. Since the perceptrons are trained on language-specific data, I also evaluate how well perceptrons trained on one language perform on other languages. The single features are also evaluated for the merit they contribute to the classification. I show that the accuracy of the Multilayer Perceptron is on a par with that of other classifiers such as Support Vector Machines.
I conclude that the quality of general-purpose boilerplate detectors depends mainly on the availability of many well-engineered features and which are highly language-independent.
The method has been implemented in the open-source texrex web page cleaning software, and large corpora constructed using it are available from the COW initiative, including the CommonCOW corpora created from CommonCrawl data sets.},

	Abstract = {Over the last decade, methods of web corpus construction and the evaluation of web corpora have been actively researched. Prominently, the WaCky initiative has provided both theoretical results and a set of web corpora for selected European languages. We present a software toolkit for web corpus construction and a set of siginificantly larger corpora (up to over 9 billion tokens) built using this software. First, we discuss how the data should be collected to ensure that it is not biased towards certain hosts. Then, we describe our software toolkit which performs basic cleanups as well as boilerplate removal, simple connected text detection as well as shingling to remove duplicates from the corpora. We finally report evaluation results of the corpora built so far, for example w. r. t. the amount of duplication contained and the text type/genre distribution. Where applicable, we compare our corpora to the WaCky corpora, since it is inappropriate, in our view, to compare web corpora to traditional or balanced corpora. While we use some methods applied by the WaCky initiative, we can show that we have introduced incremental improvements.},

	Abstract = {Eigennamenerkennung ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil der maschinellen Aufbereitung von Texten. Sowohl f{\"u}r die theoretische Linguistik als auch f{\"u}r weiterf{\"u}hrende automatische Sprachverarbeitungsschritte stellt sie eine wesentliche Voraussetzung dar. Besonders f{\"u}r die morphologisch komplexe Sprache Deutsch ist dies eine Herausforderung, nicht zuletzt, da es sich um eine der wenigen Sprachen handelt, in der zus{\"a}tzlich zu Eigennamen (EN) auch alle anderen Substantive gro{\ss} geschrieben werden. Somit f{\"a}llt die Kapitalisierung von W{\"o}rtern als grundlegender Hinweis f{\"u}r das Vorliegen eines EN weg. Dies f{\"u}hrt zu einer wesentlich schlechteren Performanz von EN-Erkennern auf deutschen Texten im Vergleich zu englischen beispielsweise. Dieser Performanzunterschied l{\"a}sst sich bereits f{\"u}r meist stark editiertes Zeitungsmaterial beobachten. Unter dem Aspekt der wachsenden Bedeutung von Internetdaten als Grundlage f{\"u}r linguistische Forschung ist es nun besonders relevant zu {\"u}berpr{\"u}fen, wie verl{\"a}sslich EN-Erkenner auf den meist sehr heterogenen Web-Korpora funktionieren, in denen auch eher spontansprachliches Material, wie beispielsweise Forentexte, enthalten ist. In Rahmen dieser Arbeit habe ich daher drei frei zug{\"a}ngliche state-of-the-art Software-Tools auf einem aus dem webgecrawlten DECOW2012-Korpus abgeleiteten, manuell erstellten Goldstandard evaluiert, die speziell f{\"u}r die EN-Erkennung in deutschen Texten entworfen wurden. Der f{\"u}r den Goldstandard genutzte Teil des DECOW2012 wurde zuvor nach Genres klassifiziert, sodass genaue Aussagen {\"u}ber den Performanzunterschied der Tools auf st{\"a}rker editierten und weniger editierten Textsorten m{\"o}glich ist. Zus{\"a}tzlich wird eine detaillierte statistische Fehleranalyse durchgef{\"u}hrt, woraus abschlie{\ss}end M{\"o}glichkeiten zur Verbesserung der Performanz von automatischen EN-Erkennungsprogrammen abgeleitet werden. },

	Abstract = {In web corpus construction, crawling is a necessary step, and it is probably the most costly of all, because it requires expensive bandwidth usage, and excess crawling increases storage requirements. Excess crawling results from the fact that the web contains a lot of redundant content (duplicates and near-duplicates), as well as other material not suitable or desirable for inclusion in web corpora or web indexes (for example, pages with little text or virtually no text at all). An optimized crawler for web corpus construction would ideally avoid crawling such content in the first place, saving bandwidth, storage, and post-processing costs. In this paper, we show in three experiments that two simple scores are suitable to improve the ratio between corpus size and crawling effort for web corpus construction. The first score is related to overall text quality of the page containing the link, the other one is related to the likelihood that the local block enclosing a link is boilerplate.},

By detailed descriptions of the implementation and systematic evaluations of the performance of the software on different types of systems, I show that the COW14 architecture is capable of handling the creation of corpora of up to at least 100 billion tokens. I also introduce our running demo system which currently serves corpora of up to roughly 20 billion tokens in Dutch, Englisch, French, German, Spanish, and Swedish.},

We first focus on web crawling and the pros and cons of the existing crawling strategies. Then, we describe how the crawled data can be linguistically pre-processed in a parallelized way that allows the processing of web-scale input data. As we are working with web data, controlling the quality of the resulting corpus is an important issue, which we address by showing how corpus statistics and a linguistic evaluation can be used to assess the quality of corpora. Finally, we show how the availability of extremely large, high-quality corpora opens up new directions for research in various fields of linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing.},

Web documents often contain material which disqualifies them from inclusion in a corpus (tag clouds, lists of names or nouns, etc.). First, we look at the agreement between coders (especially corpus designers) given the task of rating text quality. Then, we evaluate a simple and fully unsupervised method of text quality assessment based on short and very frequent words. Finally, we describe our general approach to the construction of carefully cleansed and non-destructively normalized web corpora. Under this approach, we annotate documents with quality metrics instead of actually removing those documents classified as being of low quality.},

@book{SchaeferBildhauer2013,
	Abstract = {The World Wide Web constitutes the largest existing source of texts written in a great variety of languages. A feasible and sound way of exploiting this data for linguistic research is to compile a static corpus for a given language. There are several adavantages of this approach: (i) Working with such corpora obviates the problems encountered when using Internet search engines in quantitative linguistic research (such as non-transparent ranking algorithms). (ii) Creating a corpus from web data is virtually free. (iii) The size of corpora compiled from the WWW may exceed by several orders of magnitudes the size of language resources offered elsewhere. (iv) The data is locally available to the user, and it can be linguistically post-processed and queried with the tools preferred by her/him. This book addresses the main practical tasks in the creation of web corpora up to giga-token size. Among these tasks are the sampling process (i.e., web crawling) and the usual cleanups including boilerplate removal and removal of duplicated content. Linguistic processing and problems with linguistic processing coming from the different kinds of noise in web corpora are also covered. Finally, the authors show how web corpora can be evaluated and compared to other corpora (such as traditionally compiled corpora).},
